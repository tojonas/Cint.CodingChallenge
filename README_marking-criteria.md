# Marking criteria
This describes the marking criteria that Cint will use to assess coding challenge solutions.

We want to provide candidates with this so that we are transparent about what our team (and our company) values.

## Score sheet
Each reviewer will assess solutions based on the below guide (in no particular order):

| Area | Score [1-4] | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Logic |  |  |
| Readability |  |  |
| Architecture | |  |
| Maintainability |  |  |
| Coupling |  |  |
| Cohesion |  |  |
| Testing |  |  |
| Technicality |  |  |
| OO Design |  |  |
| Efficiency  |  |  |
| Overall |  |  |
| **Total** |  |  |


## Area definitions
Below are some loose definitions for the above areas:
<dl>
  <dt>Logic</dt>
  <dd>How well the code solves the requirements.</dd>

  <dt>Readability</dt>
  <dd>How easy it is to read and understand the code.</dd>

  <dt>Architecture</dt>
  <dd>How well is the code designed and layed out.</dd>

  <dt>Maintainability</dt>
  <dd>How easy will it be to change the code in the future.</dd>

  <dt>Coupling</dt>
  <dd>How well are inter-dependent components considered.</dd>

  <dt>Cohesion</dt>
  <dd>How well are components purposed.</dd>

  <dt>Testing</dt>
  <dd>How well are components tested.</dd>

  <dt>Technicality</dt>
  <dd>How well are components implemented given constraints of the technology.</dd>

  <dt>OO Design</dt>
  <dd>How well the code follows Object Orientated design principles, such as SOLID.</dd>

  <dt>Efficiency</dt>
  <dd>How well does the code utilise system resources, such as CPU and RAM.</dd>

  <dt>Overall</dt>
  <dd>How well thoughtout and implemented is the solution in general.</dd>
</dl>

## Score definitions
Below are some loose definitions for each scoring level:

1. **Does not meet basic levels** - demonstrates a lack of understanding and execution
2. **Basic level** - demonstrates a fundamental understanding and execution
3. **Intermediate level** - demonstrates a moderate understanding and execution
4. **Advanced level** - demonstrates significant understanding and execution
