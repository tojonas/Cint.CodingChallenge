# Front-end tasks
The search field on the front-end website should be converted to an auto-complete style input element. As the user types search text into the input element, the results are rendered underneath the element, similar to this:

The selected result's details then need to be rendered after a survey has been selected. The details should also include the incentive (euros) and the length (minutes), in a presentable way.
